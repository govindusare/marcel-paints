The thin bed solution reduces the weight-strain on a building structure. Higher bond, compressive & tensile strength increase the durability of the structure. A longer pot life gives more time for the worker to fix the material. This minimized the wastage of material. It is well packed in a bag, increasing the portability of the product. It provides excellent adhesion between different blocks and also between blocks and other porous cementation surfaces. It is eco-friendly and thus minimizes its impact on the environment.",
